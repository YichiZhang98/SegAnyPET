## Overview

* SegAnyPET is a modality-specific foundational model for universal promptable segmentation from 3D PET images. SegAnyPET is trained on a collection of 5,000+ whole-body PET images with a broader spectrum of multi-organ segmentation which can be generalized for universal segmentation from PET images.

## ðŸ“š Data

We have now released the labels of AutoPET-Organ dataset at `AutoPET-OrganlabelsTr.zip`. AutoPET-Organ is a small subset of 100 cases of AutoPET with all 12 testing organs involved in our study, including liver, left kidney, right kidney, heart, spleen, aorta, prostate, left lung lower lobe, right lung lower lobe, left lung upper lobe, right lung upper lobe, and right lung middle lobe. The original images can be acquired following the [official website](https://autopet.grand-challenge.org).

## :link: Checkpoint

* We provide model checkpoints of SegAnyPET at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/YichiZhang98/SegAnyPET). SegAnyPET is adapted from [SAM-Med3D](https://github.com/uni-medical/SAM-Med3D) and retains the core functionality and usage patterns, while being optimized for universal segmentation from Positron Emission Tomography images effectively.


## ðŸ”¨ Usage

* We are organizing our training and evaluation code and will make it publicly available soon.
