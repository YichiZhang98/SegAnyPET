## Overview

* SegAnyPET is a modality-specific foundational model for universal promptable segmentation from 3D PET images. SegAnyPET is trained on a collection of 5,000+ whole-body PET images with a broader spectrum of multi- organ segmentation which can be generalized for universal segmentation.

## :link: Checkpoint

* We provide model checkpoints of SegAnyPET at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/YichiZhang98/SegAnyPET).


## ðŸ”¨ Usage

* Our code is adapted from [SAM-Med3D](https://github.com/uni-medical/SAM-Med3D). We are organizing our training and evaluation code and will make it publicly available soon.
